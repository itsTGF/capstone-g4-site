# Capstone Website Project - Recipe Rundown

A web application that connects to an SQL database loaded with recipe and food data from various sources and displays them using PHP

## Prompt

The goal was simple: select a general theme, pull data from an API, fill a database with that data, and display it on a web app.

## The Project

The project was divided into four parts, with the first two being solo-only and the last two being a collaborative effort. 

Each member selected a different API to use and wrote a small program that collects data from the API and inserts it into the SQL database.

Once the database was filled, we all worked on the frontend application using PHP and styling it with CSS.

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Backend: PHP 8.2
- Database: Microsoft SQL Server
- APIs: Edamam, OpenFood, Recipe4U, TheMealDB
